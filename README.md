# Cresco - 90 Days to Build a Lifestyle

**Cresco** is an innovative web app designed to help users build better habits over the course of 90 days. Through seamless tracking, AI-generated stories, and fantasy-themed scenarios, Cresco motivates users to develop good habits while also addressing bad ones. The goal is to guide users in creating a better lifestyle while keeping them engaged through fun and immersive elements.

This app will be developed as a web application and later wrapped as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to enable easy mobile deployment. The app will track various user activities, progress, and goals over a 90-day period, with the added benefit of fantasy-themed challenges and stories that adapt to the user's progress and achievements.

## **Goal of the Project:**
Cresco aims to create an enjoyable and engaging experience where users can:
- **Track Habits**: Monitor both good and bad habits and track their progress over time.
- **Take Progress Photos**: Document their journey visually by capturing photos that reflect their lifestyle progress.
- **Track Calendar**: Stay organized and on track with their habits and progress using an integrated calendar system.
- **AI-Generated Scenarios & Stories**: Provide immersive, fantasy-themed challenges, where users are guided by AI-generated scenarios that evolve as they progress in their journey.
- **Build World Challenges**: Users face world-building challenges that evolve based on their real-world actions and progress, keeping them motivated and immersed in their goals.
